## Sequelize Migrator

This is a basic, currently non-working example of umzug and sequelize migration functionality to migrate databases i.e. mysql, postgres

Start by looking at at the up/down scripts, and then at the files in the migration directories within `lib/cat` or `lib/dog`

### Prerequisites
Create a database called `sequelize-migrator` in postgres


### Usage pages:
[Sequelize migrations](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/migrations/)

[Umzug usage](https://github.com/sequelize/umzug)
